# 📚 Data and Information Management Project 💖

Hi there! Welcome to my **Data and Information Management Project**. ✨  
For this coursework assignment, I designed and built a **mock database** for a real-world company — a bookstore called **“Pustaka Chiew Sdn Bhd”** located in Seri Iskandar. 🏬📖  

The project was developed using **Oracle SQL** and completed in **three main phases**: designing the ERD, creating & inserting tables, and performing search, update, join, and merge operations.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **Oracle SQL**

---

## ✨ Features
Here’s what you can do with this project:  
- Design and analyze an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
- Create, insert, and drop tables in Oracle SQL  
- Perform queries like **search, update, join, and merge operations**  
- Demonstrate structured database workflows across multiple documentation phases  

---

## 📝 The Process
1. **ERD Design**  
   I started by designing an ERD to define **entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints** for the bookstore system. This ensured the database was logical, consistent, and reflected real-world operations.  

2. **Table Creation & Data Insertion**  
   After finalizing the design, I created tables, inserted data, and managed table structures using Oracle SQL commands like `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `DROP`.  

3. **SQL Operations**  
   Finally, I implemented **search, update, join, and merge queries** to manipulate and analyze the data. Each phase was completed as a separate component and documented with a project report.

## 🎓 What I Learned
### 🧩 Database Design Principles
- How to avoid redundancy and duplication  
- Importance of strong relational connections between entities  
- Concepts of **superclass, subclass, inheritance, generalization, and specialization**  

### 🛡️ Data Integrity, Security & Structure
- Preventing data loss through proper relationship modeling  
- Understanding **concurrency and consistency** in databases  
- Learning **access control and permission management** to protect sensitive information  

### 🌍 Long-Term System Thinking
- Designing databases with **scalability and adaptability** in mind  
- Applying my lecturer’s philosophy:  
  *“Design a database by thinking 5 years into the past, 1 year in the present, and 10 years into the future.”* 💡  

---

## 🚀 How Can It Be Improved?
- Convert the SQL scripts into a **real-world deployable database system**  
- Integrate a **sample front-end or reporting interface** to simulate business usage  
- Add **stored procedures, triggers, and constraints** for stronger automation  
- Include **performance tuning and indexing** for scalability  

---

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Save the SQL text files to your local machine  
2. Open **Oracle SQL** or **SQL*Plus** terminal  
3. Run each script by providing the **file path** in the terminal
